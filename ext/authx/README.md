# AuthX

The AuthX extension provides support for additional authentication protocols on CiviCRM pages.
This is useful for automated testing and developing multi-modal pageflows (eg email => HTTP).

## Overview

There are two general flows of authentication:

* __Ephemeral / Stateless__: The client submits a singlular request (such as an API call) which includes credentials. The request is authenticated and processed, but then it is abandoned.
  There are a couple flavors of stateless authentication:
    * __Parameter (`param`)__: The credential is submitted with an HTTP GET or POST parameter (`?_authx=<credential>`)
    * __Common Header (`header`)__: The credential is submitted with an HTTP (`Authorization:`). Depending on the credential, this will use either `Basic` or `Bearer`.
      The standard header is easier to integrate with external applications; however, other features or plugins in the CMS may interfere with correct operation.
    * __X-Header (`xheader`)__: The credential is again submitted with an HTTP header (`X-Civi-Auth:`). The header behaves the same as the common header. The
      differing name means that clients must specifically support it, but it also reduces the odsd of interference.
* __Persistent / Stateful__: The client makes a request for a persistent session, attaching the contact ID and/or user ID. These will be used in subsequent requests.
    * __End-point session (`endpoint`)__: The client submits an explicit authentication request (`POST /civicrm/authx/login?_authx=<credential>`) which creates a session and cookie.
      The authenticated session endures until one logs out (`/civicrm/authx/logout`).
    * __Auto session (`auto`)__: The clients submits a GET request for any page (`?_authx=<credential>&_authxSes=1`). The session is initialized. The user redirects
      to original page.

Each flow may (configurably) accept any of these credentials:

* __JSON Web Tokens (`jwt`)__: These tokens must be generated by Civi using a cryptographic signing key and expiration time.
  The client submits the token as its sole credential.
* __API Key (`api_key`)__: The user configures a value for `civicrm_contact.api_key`. The client submits
  the token as its sole credential.
* __Username/Password (`pass`)__: The client submits the username and password for a CMS user.

CiviCRM `Contact` records are often linked to CMS `User` records -- but not always. There are different ways to approach this matching:

* __Ignore__: Ignore any related `User` accounts. From a CMS perspective, the user is anonymous.
* __Optional__:  If there is a correlated CMS `User`, then load it. If there isn't, leave the CMS user as anonymous.
* __Require__: Only allow authentication if proceed if there is a correlated user account.

## Configuration

For each authentication flow, one may toggle support for different credentials and user-links. Here is the default configuration:

* Ephemeral: Parameter flow
    * Accepted credentials (`authx_param_cred`): `['jwt']`
    * User link (`authx_param_user`): `'optional'`
* Ephemeral: Common header flow
    * Accepted credentials (`authx_header_cred`): `['jwt']`
    * User link (`authx_header_user`): `'optional'`
* Ephemeral: X header flow
    * Accepted credentials (`authx_xheader_cred`): `['jwt']`
    * User link (`authx_xheader_user`): `'optional'`
* Persistent: End-point session flow
    * Accepted credentials (`authx_endpoint_cred`): `['jwt']`
    * User link (`authx_endpoint_user`): `require`
* Persistent: Auto session flow
    * Accepted credentials (`authx_auto_cred`): `['paramalogin']` for Joomla, and `[]` for all others
    * User link (`authx_auto_user`): `require`

## Quirks and Compatibility

Some modes may not be supported in some environments. For example:

* __Joomla, WordPress__: Creates extraneous sessions (e.g. even if the request is for stateless authentication).
* __WordPress__: The default `.htaccess` in WordPress may obscure the common  `Authorization:` header. Fix this by adding:
    ```
    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
    ```

## Examples

### JSON Web Token

```php
// First, on the server, prepare a token
$token = Civi::service('authx.jwt')->create([
  'contact_id' => 123,
  'ttl' => 5*60*60,
]);

// Next, on the client, use this same token
$options = ['http' => [
    'method'  => 'GET',
    'header' => 'Authorization: Bearer '.$token
]];
$context  = stream_context_create($options);
$response = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);
```

### Username and Password

```php
$auth = base64_encode("username:password");
$context = stream_context_create([
    "http" => [
        "header" => "Authorization: Basic $auth"
    ]
]);
$homepage = file_get_contents("http://example.com/file", false, $context );
```
