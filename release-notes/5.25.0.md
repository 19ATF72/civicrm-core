  Work [dev/core#561](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/561):

  [16863](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16863))**

  These changes continue work to move to datepicker from jcalendar by converting
  report instances from using the legacy jcalendar to using datepicker for date
  fields and deprecating the `addDateRange` function used by jcalendar.

- **End of life plans for php 7.0 & deprecate php 7.1
  ([dev/core#1528](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1528):
  [16753](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16753),
  [599](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/599),
  [598](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/598),
  [111](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/pull/111),
  [16678](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16678),

  ([dev/core#1613](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1613):
  [16651](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16651))**

  Changes the text of the confirm contribution (and event registration) button
  to "Review".

- **APIv4 - Add Dashboard & DashboardContact entities
  ([16867](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16867))**

  Adds APIv4 support for Dashboard & DashboardContact and does some cleanup in
  the BAO and API layers for improved consistency.

  ([17014](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17014))**

  [16947](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16947))**

  Builds out the APIv4 framework to support GROUP BY and different types of
  expressions in clauses that previously only accepted the names of fields.
  These expressions can now include numbers, NULL, strings, and whitelisted SQL
  functions. The framework can in theory handle most SQL functions, but this
  first PR adds support for the aggregate functions AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN & SUM.

### CiviContribute

  [dev/financial#87](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/87):

  [17215](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17215))**

  In Search Builder, searching by activity type would return no results,
  affecting not only direct searches but also smart groups that built with
  Search Builder.  This resolves the regression, which first appeared in 5.24.3.

- **Need to Increase Data Size for `form_values` column on
  civicrm_report_instance table
  ([dev/core#1569](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1569):

  patches to ensure CiviCRM customisations for CRM-1367 and CRM-5946 are applied

  label ([dev/report#28](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/28):
  [16829](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16829))**

### CiviCase

- **Various errors recorded in log message on Manage Case screen -> relationship
  tab. ([dev/core#1664](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1664):

  ([dev/core#1646](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1646):
  [16798](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16798))**

  Ensures the Merge Case Modal shows all relevant cases.

- **Adding a timeline to a case doesn't get the last activity in the timeline
  right ([dev/core#1675](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1675) and
  [dev/core#1695](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1695):

### CiviContribute

- **Changes to CiviContribute Component Settings not saved
  ([dev/core#1724](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1724):
  [17188](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17188))**

  The way that CiviContribute component settings were stored was updated for
  5.23, but the transition during the upgrade was problematic.  This replaces
  the transition code, resolving issues for sites upgrading directly from 5.22.x
  or earlier.  Sites on 5.23.x or 5.24.x should review their settings, however.

- **Invoice action not shown when invoicing enabled
  ([17164](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17164))**

  The cumulative contributions display from a contribution page would needlessly
  filter contributions by date, with the end date being midnight on the current
  date.  That would exclude contributions received on the current day.

- **Fix Bug where Payment Balance is sometimes miscalculated
  ([16546](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16546))**

  Fixes a bug where Add Refund is displayed instead of Add Payment on partially
  paid event contributions.

  ([14667](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14667))**

  Ensures when a user creates a donation via paypal their CiviCRM contact name
  is not overwritten to be their paypal account name.

- **Fix use col "Soft Credit Amount Stats" and any filter of contribution…
  ([16591](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16591))**

  ([dev/core#1682](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1682):

  created from an offline membership form.

  ([dev/drupal#110](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/110):

  [600](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/600))**
